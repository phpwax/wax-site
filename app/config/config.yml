##### config.yml file use to configure applications ###
# Environments: Setup ip sniffing to detect environments
# 
#  Hopefully entirely unnecessary most of the time - 
#  Local ranges 127., 10. and 192. default to development


# environments:
#   development:  172.*
#   production:   86.54.101.70



# == Database configuration ==
development:
 db:
  dbtype: none  
  host: localhost
  database: app_development
  username: root

test:

    dbtype: mysql

#  == Maintenance downtime == 
#  Use to make the site unavailable to all but one ip
#  Just comment the lines out to operate the site normally. Note that this will need to be your public ip address.
#  Redirect gives an address to redirect all requests to.
#  the ip can be a yaml array or a single ip - both regex 
#maintenance: 
  #ip:       ^127.0.0*
  #redirect: 503.html



# == CACHE ==
# To speed up page loads you can enable caching for certain elements within phpwax. All will take white or
# black lists (inclusions / exclusions) in the form of regular expressions (passed to a preg_match call).
#
# I would suggest that anything you turn on here you set to false in development.php with a Config::set() call
# in order to avoid seeing cached content while working locally!
#
# layout_cache:
#  This will cache the entire page and if used properly can load the entire page request from cache with no
#  need to load in the framework; just a few dependancies
#
# view_cache
#  While turned on individual views can be cached, so when the template is rendered the view is simply read 
#  from cache and does not have to parse the view
#
# partial_cache
#  Much like view_cache, only for partial calls
#
# image_cache
#  Currently specific to the show_image function that comes with Wildfire CMS; but using this
#  will use the cached versions of image files instead of having to render them in the framework
